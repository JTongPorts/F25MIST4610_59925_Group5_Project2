## Dataset Description:

Source of the Dataset: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/traffic-crashes-crashes <br>

The dataset was obtained from the City of Chicago Open Data Portal, originally published through Data.gov under the title “Traffic Crashes – Crashes.” It is maintained by the Chicago Police Department (CPD) and reflects crash records collected through their E-Crash electronic reporting system. The data includes all reported traffic crashes occurring on public roadways within Chicago city limits, excluding crashes recorded by agencies outside CPD jurisdiction (such as interstate highway authorities).

Data is continually updated as CPD finalizes crash reports or if amendments are made to existing records.
